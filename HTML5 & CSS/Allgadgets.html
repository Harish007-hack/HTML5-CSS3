            <h3>Realme X3 SuperZoom</h3>
            <div class="info">
            <p>
               The Realme X3 SuperZoom features a periscope-style telephoto camera, which is the first we've seen in this price segment. The 8-megapixel telephoto camera features 5x optical zoom and a maximum of 60x hybrid zoom. Camera performance is very good during the day, but not so much at night. To help with the latter, there's Night mode, which is quite effective. The main 64-megapixel camera captures good photos in daylight, but struggles a bit in low light. The X3 SuperZoom can record video at 4K and the quality is good in the day, but could be better when shooting at night. 
                                                       <br>
 <br>
The X3 SuperZoom uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ SoC, which offers plenty of processing power for apps and games. The phone also featrues a 120Hz refresh rate LCD panel, so scrolling through menus feels fluid. Battery life is also solid. The X3 SuperZoom is also very well built and looks stylish. It's mising stereo speakers but the single bottom-firing speaker gets pretty loud. The phone runs Realme UI, based on Android 10.

            <h3>OnePlus 8</h3>
            <div class="info">
            <p>
    The OnePlus 8 is the spiritual successor of the OnePlus 7 and will go on to eventually replace the OnePlus 7T. Build quality is excellent thanks to the curved-edge front and back glass sandwiching the metal frame. The buttons are easy to reach, and the alert slider is handy as always.
                                                                       <br>
 <br>
The OnePlus 8 has a 6.55-inch AMOLED panel with sloping sides, a wide colour gamut, and a hole-punch cutout in the upper left corner. The 90Hz refresh rate makes usage in general feel fluid and snappy. It also has an in-display fingerprint sensor, which is super quick at authentication. All it takes is a quick, firm tap to unlock it.
                                                                       <br>
 <br>
We reviewed the top-end variant of the OnePlus 8, which has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, priced at Rs. 49,999. Gaming performance is top-notch. Fortnite can run at 90fps and the experience is good. Games and movies are especially enjoyable thanks to the very good stereo speakers on the OnePlus 8. OxygenOS is also well equipped with lots of shortcuts and gestures waiting to be discovered. The new launcher now offers a more seamless multitasking experience, there's 5GB of free cloud storage for backups once you sign in with a OnePlus account, a built-in screen recorder, and dynamic wallpapers.
                                                                       <br>
 <br>
The OnePlus 8 has the same 48-megapixel Sony IMX586 sensor with optical stabilisation as the 7T. In daylight, it captures detailed images with vivid colours and balanced HDR. The wide-angle camera is also useful. The third macro camera doesn't have good clarity but it can be useful in some instances. The selfie camera was decent under good light but didn't do well in low light.
                                                                       <br>

            <h3>OnePlus 8 pro</h3>
            <div class="info">
            <p>
The OnePlus 8 Pro has a similar design as the OnePlus 8 but with some subtle changes. Its display is actually rounded on the sides, rather than just having curved glass like on the 8. It has a pretty big 6.78-inch QHD+ (1440x3168-pixel) AMOLED panel, with a claimed high colour accuracy and HDR10+ support. New this year is the 120Hz refresh rate. The display is vibrant, colourful, and bright.
                                                                                    <br>
 <br>
The software experience is very similar to that of the OnPlus 8, with the exception of controls for some additions such as reverse wireless charging and video playback enhancement. The interface feels snappy, and OxygenOS in general runs very well.
                                                                                    <br>
 <br>
 App and gaming performance is pretty solid. The stereo speakers sound great and the Dolby Atmos setting helps improve quality and spatial separation.
                                                                                    <br>
 <br>
The rear cameras get a big upgrade. The main 48-megapixel camera captures very good details nd colours under most lighting conditions. The wide-angle camera also shoots grat pictures and can even do extreme close-up photography. The telephoto camera is good too, and nearly on par with the Samsung Galaxy S20+ in terms of quality. 
                                                                                    <br>
 <br>
Battery life is excellent but the big addtion here, is wireless charging. The 8 Pro also supports reverse wireless charging. 
                                                                                    <br>

            <h3>Realme X50 Pro 5G</h3>
            <div class="info">
            <p>
The Realme X50 Pro is 5G ready and features the top-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor. In terms of performance, this device is excellent for gaming as well as general productivity. Realme has also used high-speed RAM and storage, plus a 90Hz display, for a snappy overall experience. This is a mid-range flagship phone that truly can take on many of the much more expensive models in the market. 
                                                                                  <br>
 <br>
The X50 Pro 5G is available in two muted colour options and looks quite premium with its glass and metal body. However, the back is slippery and this phone is somewhat bulky and heavy. What you'll notice first is the dual-camera cutout in the upper left corner of the screen.
                                                                                  <br>
 <br>
The display is sharp and the speakers are surprisingly powerful. You get four rear cameras including a 2X optical zoom camera. We found photos to generally be very good, even ones shot with the lower-resolution wide-angle and zoom cameras. However, photos taken at night weren't always great, and 4K video looked artificial.
                                                                                  <br>

            <h3>Xiaomi Mi 10</h3>
            <div class="info">
            <p>
Xiaomi has made a bold move by launching the Mi 10 5G in India at a starting price of Rs. 49,999. The curved glass on the front and back of this phone looks classy. This, coupled with the high-gloss finish makes it striking to look at. The Mi 10 5G has a 6.67-inch AMOLED screen and is sharp enough, but the resolution is full-HD+ (2340x1080). The display also runs at 90Hz, which is a big trend right now.
<br><br>
Xiaomi says that the Mi 10 has a P2i coating to repel water, but there isn't any IP rating. Other than this, it has almost everything you can think of, starting with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoC, LPDDR5 RAM, UFS 3.0 storage, an in-display fingerprint sensor, Wi-Fi 6, fast wireless charging, and 5G.
<br><br>
It runs on MIUI 11 and Xiaomi has replaced some of its own apps like the dialler and messages with Google's apps. However, spam notifications are still an issue, although it's not as severe as its budget offerings. 
<br><br>
The Snapdragon 865 is a powerful chip but it also makes the phone quite hot when using the camera or even gaming. The stereo spakers sound balanced but don't get very loud. The in-display fingerprint sensor on the other hand is not very quick, and it took a good second before it recognised our finger and unlocked the phone. 
<br><br>
Xiaomi is making a big deal about its 108-megapixel primary camera, which performs well in daylight and at night. The other cameras are a wide-angle and macro, which work decently well in the day but aren't very good in low light. The 20-megapixel selfie camera is also decent but not great at night. 
<br><br>
Battery life is very good on the Mi 10 5G, as it typically lasts for an entire day. Fast charging helps and there's even reverse wireless charging.
